Hey all,

Please take a moment to cast a ballot for the GSC representative for Physics (certificates required):

<https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu:444/gscelection2015/>

The election closes on *19 February 2015*.

Recall that the MIT Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the institute-wide body of graduate student representatives. Having an active representative on the GSC eases the planning of interdisciplinary activities and provides additional funds theretoward.

Thanks,

Kiaran Dave
PGSC President
