Hey all,

Please take a moment to cast a ballot for the three GSC representatives for Physics (certificates required):

<https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu:444/election2016/>

The election closes on *June 17th 2016*.

Recall that the MIT Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the institute-wide body of graduate student representatives. Having active representatives on the GSC eases the planning of interdisciplinary activities and provides additional funds theretoward.

Thanks,

Constantin Weisser
PGSC President
